# 2D Unsteady Heat Diffusion (PINNs + FDM)

## üìù Overview
This project explores the 2D unsteady heat diffusion equation in aluminum using:
- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** (two different versions)
- **Finite Difference Method (FDM)** for comparison

We implement deep learning models that respect the heat equation as a constraint, then compare their accuracy and performance to a classical numerical solver.

## üßë‚Äçüíª What‚Äôs Included
- `square.ipynb` ‚Äî First version of the PINN model
- `Final_void.ipynb` ‚Äî Improved version of the PINN model
- `data/` ‚Äî Input files (e.g. `.xlsx`)
- `figures/` ‚Äî Plots and screenshots of results
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äî Python dependencies
